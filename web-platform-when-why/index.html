            Thank you for coming to The Right Choice. In this session I'm going to tell
            you about the Web as a platform, what are the benefits of Web technologies and

            This is the agenda for the talk. Let me convince you about why you should love
            the Web, then I'll explain what are the main factors preventing the Web from
            being a competitive alternative to native solutions. To follow up, let's see how
            modern technologies will bring the a native platform UX to Web applications
            and finally, let's review some successful examples, resources and
            give the proper credit.

              not shifting the focus but going multiplatform. HTML5 is already universal. It is

              The other benefit is actually the great differentiator. The Web spreads through the Internet
              which is not a propietary marketplace but a completely free information network. The URL is
              viral, any place in the Internet can point you to any Web application without ever facing an
              installation. You click the link, you get working content.

              Well, there are obvious reasons for not to choose the Web. For instance, if the platform does
              not cover your API needs. But, even when this is not a problem and having such exclusive and
              attractive features as the aforementioned interoperability and lack of friction features,
              the Web does not seem to fit our needs. Why?

            <p><strong>User experience</strong></p>
            <aside class="notes">
              The answer is user experience. In the beginning, the Web was not designed for mobile usage.
              We surfed the Web from our desktops, with powerful multicore computers and a big screen and
              reliable &amp; fast network connections.

              In the mobile realm you can not rely on always being connected. If the connectivity is lost,
              the experience is broken. The complete application vanishes. Of course a user can understand
              for an online application not tofor  show content if offlibut to breaking with no
              information? I don't think so.

              When browsing from the desktop, we are in a Web mindset paying attention to the browser
              and actively consuming information. In the mobile experience, we are not longer paying
              special attention to any not immediate task. We are used to receive notifications upon
              important things. Until now, this was something impossible to do for the Web loosing
              the opportunity to re-engage the user.

            <aside class="notes">
              And last but not least, there is more about perceived performance. Interoperability
              comes with a cost on translation overhead and this reduces the effective speed of the
              technology. In the Web, we need to be extra careful to keep things flowing. Given the
              single thread nature of JavaScript, if a computation takes so long, frames per second
              will drop under 60 fps giving the sensation of slow and jagged animations.

              Anyway, HTML5 core technologies have been proved easy and popular and several native

              a native container. The problem now is that these applications are forced to use the
              marketplace for distribution again.

            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              As you probably know, a worker is a JS program that runs in a separated thread. The news
              about service workers is that they does not require the browser to be open at all. Once
              registered, the Service Worker will wake up to attend to specific events.

              These events are now three: fetch, sync &amp; push.

            <img alt="Fetch event" src="./imgs/fetch-event.png" style="width: 70%"/>
            <aside class="notes">
              The first one, fetch, is triggered each time a client page is performing an HTTP request
              for a resource or navigation. That is, it's a programmable proxy hijacking request to
              response is a customized way.

              In addition to the fetch event, new cache API allow for storing pairs of HTTP request and
              responses. So we can go to network, retrieve the content, cache it and re-use from cache
              in the following requests.

            <aside class="notes">
              Contrary to fetch or sync events, push events originate from the network and are sent
              to the applications. After a client subscribe to the Push service, the client sends the
              subscription information to its remote server. Now when the server receive information for
              the client, it can communicate this info to the client through the Push server. Like SSE
              events but not requiring the app to be open.

              Combined with the notification API, the Web app can visibly notify the user about some

            <aside class="notes">
              Finally, sync events are triggered in two ways but currently only one is implemented in the
              browsers. The sync event happens each time the device regains connectivity. A sync event
              can serve to perform background operations such as receiving incoming events or
              synchronizing with servers.
