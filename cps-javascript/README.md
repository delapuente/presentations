# Continuation Passing Style with JavaScript

Here you have my presentation for the [DEVCON1](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23devcon1&src=typd), **Continuation Passing Style with JavaScript**.

The presentation is an introduction about CPS in JavaScript that covers the following aspects:

 * Comparison between CPS and classical style
 * Current use of CPS
 * Problems using CPS (The Pyramid of DOOM)
 * Non-blocking programming
 * Coordinating async functions (flatting the Pyramid of DOOM)
